## ✨ What’s This Trick About?
Say goodbye to boring terminal startups! With this trick, you’ll splash a custom ASCII art—like a grinning cat or a zooming rocket—onto your screen every time you launch a terminal. It’s simple, stylish, and a total vibe shift for your daily grind.

### Preview
Here’s a taste of what you might see:

```

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
No tech wizardry required—just a few basics:
- **Linux/macOS**: Any terminal (Bash, Zsh, etc.).
- **Windows**: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Git Bash for that Unix flair.
- A text editor (`nano`, `vim`, or even Notepad works).
- Git (optional, for cloning the repo—install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)).
- A sprinkle of curiosity—you’re about to have fun!

---

## 📦 Installation
Let’s get this art show on the road:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository (Optional)
Grab the goodies from GitHub for a quick start.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gl3nnnn/ASCII-Boot-Trick.git
cd terminal-artistry
```

### Step 2: Craft Your ASCII Masterpiece
Create a file for your art.
- Open your terminal and type:
  ```bash
  nano ~/boot_art.txt
  ```
- Add your ASCII design. Here’s a starter cat:

## 🎮 Usage: Step-by-Step

### 🐧 Linux/macOS: Adding the Boot Message
#### Goal
Splash your ASCII art every time your terminal opens.

#### Tools
- `boot_art.txt`: Your custom art file.
- Shell config (`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).

#### Steps
1. **Find Your Shell Config**:
   - **Bash** (Linux default):
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - **Zsh** (macOS default):
     ```bash
     nano ~/.zshrc
     ```

2. **Add the Magic**:
   - Scroll to the end and paste:
     ```bash
     cat ~/boot_art.txt
     ```
   - Want a personal touch? Add:
     ```bash
     echo "Hey [Your Name], ready to slay the day?"
     ```
   - Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

3. **See It Live**:
   - Reload your shell:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc for Zsh
     ```
   - Open a new terminal—bam, there’s your art!

4. **Tweak It**:
   - Edit `boot_art.txt` anytime to swap designs.

> **Pro Tip**: Keep your art simple for quick loading!

### 🪟 Windows (WSL/Git Bash)
#### Goal
Bring the same ASCII flair to Windows via WSL or Git Bash.

#### Tools
- WSL (e.g., Ubuntu) or Git Bash installed.
- `boot_art.txt` and `.bashrc`.

#### Steps
1. **Launch Your Shell**:
   - Open WSL (`wsl` in Command Prompt) or Git Bash.

2. **Create Your Art**:
   - In your home directory:
     ```bash
     nano ~/boot_art.txt
     ```
   - Add the cat (or your own creation) and save.

3. **Edit the Config**:
   - Open `.bashrc`:
     ```bash
     nano ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - Add:
     ```bash
     cat ~/boot_art.txt
     ```
   - Optional greeting:
     ```bash
     echo "[Your Name], the terminal king has arrived!"
     ```
   - Save and exit.

4. **Test It**:
   - Reload:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - Open a new session—your art shines!

5. **Customize**:
   - Update `boot_art.txt` for a fresh look anytime.

> **Heads-Up**: WSL might need setup—check [Microsoft’s guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if new.

## 🧠 How It Works
- **The Trick**: `cat` prints your `boot_art.txt` to the terminal.
- **The Trigger**: `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` runs commands on shell startup.
- **The Power**: A tiny tweak with a big visual punch!

---

## 🎉 Why It’s Cool
- **Personal Vibes**: Your terminal feels like *you*—not just a tool.
- **Geek Cred**: Impress friends with your custom “hacker” setup.
- **Learning Bonus**: A fun intro to shell scripting and configs.
- **Endless Fun**: Swap art daily—robots, dragons, whatever you dream up!

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions (From Scratch)
Build this repo yourself:

1. **Create the Repo**:
   - Start a new GitHub repo: `terminal-artistry`.

2. **Add Files**:
   - Save your `boot_art.txt` with the cat design.
   - Add this README as `README.md`.

3. **Push It**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Launch Terminal Artistry with ASCII boot trick"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/[your-username]/terminal-artistry.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

## 🎨 Extra Customization Ideas
- **Color It Up**: Add `echo -e "\e[32m"` before `cat` for green art (Linux/macOS).
- **Random Art**: Use multiple files and a script like:
  ```bash
  files=(~/boot_art*.txt); cat "${files[RANDOM % ${#files[@]}]}"
  ```
- **Animation**: Chain `echo` lines with `sleep` for a moving effect.
